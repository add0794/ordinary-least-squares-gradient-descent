# Predicting Academic Outcomes: Comparing Traditional and Machine Learning Techniques

## About the Paper

This project uses multiple regression to predict academic performance. Specifically, it evaluates ordinary least squares (OLS), a foundational statistical technique, against machine learning approaches such as Scikit-Learn's implementation and gradient descent optimization. The findings highlight OLS as a faster, more straightforward, and just as accurate method for multiple regression when compared to the complexity of tuning machine learning models. By leveraging real-world academic datasets, this study delves into the trade-offs of these techniques, particularly their accuracy, computational efficiency, and practical limitations, with a focus on smaller datasets.

## Usability

This repository includes both a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and an object-oriented Python script to apply multiple regression to your datasets. The Jupyter Notebook enables an interactive exploration of data preprocessing, model implementation, and results visualization, allowing you to dive deeply into the analysis and its findings. The object-oriented version encapsulates functionality into classes and methods, offering a streamlined way to test and integrate multiple regression into your projects. Whether youâ€™re working with continuous or categorical variables, this setup allows you to replicate the comparison between machine learning models (Scikit-Learn's linear regression and gradient descent) and traditional OLS methods (NumPy and SciPy), ensuring a robust evaluation of performance and usability across different tools.
